# What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?


In this project we are trying to answer the question: What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?

Background:

The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37ºC or 98.6ºF for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

Exercises:

Related to the main question, a dataset of human body temperatures is analyzed employing the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.

Files:

- data: folder containing raw data
